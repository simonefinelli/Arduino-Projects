/**
 * A Ultrasonic Sensor can be used to detect the distance of an object.
 * There are multiple ultrasonic sensor on the marketl. Here we'are utilizing the HC-SR04.
 *
 * The HC-SR04 has 4 pins:
 *  - VCC: Power (5v);
 *  - GND: Ground;
 *  - TRIG: to trig the sensor (output mode);
 *  - ECHO: receive the data (to get the distance).
 * 
 * ATTENTION: Echo pin must be connected to an Interrupt pin!
 *
 * Each sensor have its characteristics, for example this one can detect an object between 2cm to 400cm,
 * with a angle of 15 degree.
