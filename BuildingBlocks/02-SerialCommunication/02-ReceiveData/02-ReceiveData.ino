/**
 * Serial is used for communication between the Arduino board 
 * and a computer or other devices. All Arduino boards have at
 * least one serial port (also known as a UART or USART), 
 * and some have several.
 *
 * For example, Arduino UNO R3 uses serial pins 0(RX),1(TX) to receive and transmit data.
 *
 * To receive data from "outside" to Arduino we can use Serial.println.
 *
